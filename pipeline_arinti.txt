1. get data of patient (1week)
2. check avg time measured btw samples
3. for every metric 
	4. check if differencing is necessary (arima or arma)
	5. what is d? 
	6. give best pdq (auto arima)
	7. train model on +/- 20 measurements (fit)
	8. predict (5 samples/ 1,5 day)
	9. check accuracy predictions 
10. calculate EWS from predictions
